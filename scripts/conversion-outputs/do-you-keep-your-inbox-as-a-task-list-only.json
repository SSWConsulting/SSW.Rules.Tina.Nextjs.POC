As you complete a task you can just delete the email.\n\nYour inbox should only contain ['tasks'](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/dones-do-you-use-email-for-tasks-only-not-communication), that are actionable items on your list of things to do. Everything that is in your 'Inbox' (including sub-folders) should only be to-do items.\n\nSo do it now, delete all emails you have done. If you want to keep some for reference, move them to a new folder that is not in your inbox.\n"
