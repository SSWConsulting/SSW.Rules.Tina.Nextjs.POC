### üìù Adding Editorial Workflow
We've integrated TinaCMS with an editorial workflow to support content editing in a more structured way. If you're unfamiliar with how editorial workflows work in Tina, please refer to the official documentation:

üëâ [TinaCMS Editorial Workflow Documentation](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/editorial-workflow)

This workflow allows for content changes to be reviewed before being published, improving collaboration and content quality.
