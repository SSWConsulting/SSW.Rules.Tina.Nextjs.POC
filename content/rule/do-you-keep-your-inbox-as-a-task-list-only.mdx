Most people donâ€™t manage their inbox effectively. Emails should be treated as
a list to do. As you complete a task you can just delete the email.

Your inbox should only contain
['tasks'](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/dones-do-you-use-email-for-tasks-only-not-communication),
that are actionable items on your list of things to do. Everything that is in
your 'Inbox' (including sub-folders) should only be to-do items.

So do it now, delete all emails you have done. If you want to keep some for
reference, move them to a new folder that is not in your inbox.
